A simple Unity demo showing how to make a Post request to the Azure IoT Hub.
The SaS Token in here will probably be expired by the time you get this demo, but you can make your own SaS tokens at Device Explorer.
You'll want to create your own IoT Hub and change the URI to which you are making the Post request.
Detailed Docs/Blog to come.
